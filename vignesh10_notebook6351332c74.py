#Univariate analysis:

#It is method of analysis where each variable can be analysed independently.

#For analysing the distributions of each feature, I have used  4 methods:

    #1.Histogram

    #2.Boxplot

    #3.stats.skew to measure the skewness in each continuous feature

#For the first three methods, I have used the plot() function with just changing the arguements for respective plots

#ex: df.plot(kind = 'hist') for histogram. I have customized the plot using other arguements to the plot function such

 #as (subplot = True) for plotting each column (each features) independently.

#skewed. Let us confirm, if that is the case with the remaining methods.

#Method 2: Density plots

density_plot_cont = train_df_cont.plot(kind='density', subplots=True,layout = (5,3),figsize = (15,15),sharex = False)



#On analysing the density plots, it almost presents a similar picture as the histogram. The same set of features 

 #cont1,cont5,cont7,cont8,cont9,cont13 seems to be skewed, while the other features seems to be fairly symmetrical.

    
#Method 3: Box plots

#After all we are learning machine learning and avoiding redundancy is a key component hence would end the analysis

#with just stating similar results. But one key point to be highlighted in this case, is the presence of outliers 

#in the features cont 7, cont 9, cont 10.  eliminating outliers is a one of the important pre processing step before 

#applying the algorithm.
#Method 4: stats.skew

#Using the general thumb rule

#If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical

#If the skewness is between -1 and – 0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed

#Hence fetching the list of features with skewness above and below the specified limit.
